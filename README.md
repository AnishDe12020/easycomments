## Add a Site

You need to add a site to get a link for embedding the comments widget. Visit the [Sites Dashboard](https://easycomments.anishde.dev/sites) to add a site.

![Add Site Button Picutre](https://i.imgur.com/I0WCwQ4.png)

Here you need to just fill in the required fields. You can change some settings if you want to (can be changed later). After you are done, click Save.

You are almost done, you are now ready to embed the comments widget on your website

## Embed the Comments Widget

This can be done in many ways. The embed supports [Iframe Resizer](https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer). I would recommend using this. You can refer the Iframe Resizer documentation for more information.

For React - https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer-react

For Vue - https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer/blob/master/docs/use_with/vue.md

For Angular - https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer/issues/478#issuecomment-347958630

You can also embed this in any website which supports embeds (e.g. Notion)

# üíª Running locally

First clone the repository using git or download the zip and extract it.

`https://github.com/AnishDe12020/easycomments.git`

You must have NodeJS and NPM installed. We use `yarn` for manageing dependencies but you can use `npm` as well.

To install dependencies -

- With `npm`

```
npm install
```

- With `yarn`

```
yarn
```

You will need to fill out some environment vairables. Refer to [`.env.example`](https://github.com/AnishDe12020/easycomments/blob/main/.env.example)

Firstly, you need to create a new [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) account if you already don't have one. You need to create a SPA application and fill out the required fields. You can refer to the [NextJS Auth0 Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/nextjs) for a guide.

You also need to make a new project in firebase and create a web application in the same. You can refer to the [Firebase Web Setup Guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup). You are also required to create a Firebase service account. This can be done in the Firebase Proect Settings -> Service Accounts. Make sure you download the JSON file and keep it somewhere safe as it contains sensitive information and you will not be able to download it again.

For the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_EMBED_URL`, you can use the following value -

```
https://easycomments.anishde.dev/embed/EwI3VgCSuJkl85wh18Ru/
```

Now you can run the development server.

With `npm` -

```
npm run dev
```

With `yarn` -

```
yarn dev
```

Then visit [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the site in a development environment.
